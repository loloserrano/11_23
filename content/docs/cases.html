<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>20 of 103 cases, or nearly 1 in 5, were decided before 1965, when a federal law prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin finally came into effect and the U.S. was nominally no longer a racial apartheid state. (See <a href="/docs/race">Race in the Casebook?</a> for a somewhat more complex but still woefully insufficient treatment of this topic.) 73 of the 103 cases, or just under 3 in 4, were decided before the 21st century.</p>
<p><em>You can scroll around the chart - each dot has the name and year of the case it represents.
All cases are randomly dispersed along the y axis to make the individual points easier to see. Vertical position is arbitrary.
Double-click on the colored dots within the legend/key to isolate that category.</em></p>

<p>So this project looks at women and men in the case book, but it’s looking at much less than that: They’re nearly all American, mostly white, and likely much more complicated in their personal experiences of gender, race, law, and family than the casebook represents. Gender is so complicated that I devote a considerable amount of space in <a href="/docs/rereading">Rereading Contracts and Updating Frug</a> to a diatribe on gender. I use the words men and women, but with reservations.</p>
<p>So, with all that said:</p>
<div id="gender-breakdown" class="section level2">
<h2>Gender Breakdown</h2>
<p>I collected all individual people and businesses that appear as parties or representatives of parties in all opinions included in the casebook.</p>
<p>I coded the individual people for gender by making assumptions based on traditional patterns in gendered names and pronouns. In all, I counted 202 individuals appearing as parties themselves or as prominent representatives of organizations in the facts of the opinions.</p>

<p>Interestingly, women are slightly more likely to be on the plaintiff side, at 58% (31 of 53) to men’s 48% (66 of 136). But it’s not a significant difference.</p>
</div>
<div id="transaction-type" class="section level2">
<h2>Transaction Type</h2>
<p>I coded very roughly for the type of transaction that gave rise to the legal dispute.
The label ‘Business’ refers to two or more for-profit organizations interacting with each other in the course of business.
The label ‘Consumer’ refers to transactions in which an individual or several individuals purchase goods or service from organization/s
The label ‘Employee’ refers to transactions in which an individual interacts as a former/potential employee of an organization/s
The label ‘Family’ really means more interpersonal – the performances induced by these contracts are behavioral in nature, i.e. withholding smoking, being a good little nephew, transfer of money among relatives.
The label ‘Property’ refers to transactions between individuals over sale/transfer of property, not individuals interacting with homebuilders, which I counted as a consumer transaction.</p>
