# Frugging KCP

> A casebook is a powerful document. The editorial choices within a casebook determine how many readers think about the law of a doctrinal area, about lawyering in that field, about clients, and about legal reasoning.

This project analyzes American gender in [Charles Knapp](https://www.uchastings.edu/people/charles-knapp/), [Nathan M. Crystal](https://www.cgcfirm.com/people/nathan-m-crystal/), and [H.G. Prince’s](https://www.uchastings.edu/people/h-g-prince/) *Problems in Contract Law: Cases and Materials.* It is directly inspired by Mary Joe Frug's "Re-Reading Contracts: A Feminist Analysis of a Contracts Casebook. "

In doing so, it reviews historical differences in the ways American women and men have been able to live their lives. Most Americans expected women not to participate in the government or the formal economy from the country’s inception to the early twentieth century, and not to occupy public positions of capitalist power until the middle of the twentieth century. There is a massive historical disparity in the relative power of women in public.

For better or worse, the casebook does represent this dynamic. Presenting these inequalities accurately reflects the general exclusion of women from public life and contracts law for most of American history. The limited universe of American contracts presented in a this casebook provide an interesting venue to examine a snapshot of flawed, gendered, improving, complicated law.

## Mary Joe Frug 

Mary Joe Frug was a gender and legal theorist who produced brilliant work on oppressive gendered patterns in American law, some of the first postmodern feminist scholarship. Frug's Re-Reading Contracts: A Feminist Analysis of a Contracts Casebook, 34 AM. U. L. REV. 1065 (1985) is the direct inspiration for this project. 


## Table of Contents

### [On Style](/docs/on_style)

In this section I defend Frugging, Fruggism, and Fruggish. 

### [Re-Reading Contracts and Updating Frug](/docs/rereading)

In this section I describe the purpose, framework, and theory of this project. I detail the works of Mary Joe Frug on which this project is based and introduce new ideas, both from her other pieces and from later work, that complicate the idea of gender. 

### [Race in the Casebook](/docs/race)

In this section I do a summary qualitative assessment of race in the casebook. It's much more difficult to gauge and thus to quantify, so this section is much more cursory than the issue deserves. 

On the whole, race and racism are a conspicuous absence in the cases and notes in KCP. Only one case mentions racism, and despite being a heavily policy-oriented opinion fails to engage with the idea in the slightest. Several other cases have a racial subtext that KCP generally fails to address meaningfully in the notes. 

### [Data Collection and Dataset](/docs/dataset)

In this section I describe my data collection process and display some of the raw information. 

### [The Cases: General Overview](/docs/cases)

In this section I describe some very big-picture patterns in the data: general gender breakdown, transaction type, etc. Women constitute about a fourth of the individual characters in the book.

### [The Characters: Wives, Widows, and Workers](/docs/characters/_index)

In this section I get to the juicier, qualitative stuff. I explore the individual humans who appear in the casebook as characters: how they are understood, framed, and described by judges and casebook editors. Most of my focus in the section is on women, who appear as a minority of characters and in a strictly limited set of roles. Most strikingly, over half of the women appear in the litigation with a heterosexual partner; nearly another quarter of the women appear with another family member. 

### [The Characteristics: He's a Business, Man](/docs/trying)

In this section I explore general notions of masculinity and femininity as they appear in the casebook. The most striking pattern here is the number of businesses with masculine names (William G. Eurice & Bros., Inc., James Baird Co.). This raises some questions about corporate personhood, a legal fiction that allows corporations to exist and participate in the legal system. Is there an implied masculinity to the corporate "person?"

### [Pictures!](/docs/pics)

This page contains some of the pictures embedded in the text of KCP, of which the objective best is this masculine [(one might even say phallic)](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/20/opinion/joe-camel-an-xrated-smoke.html) camel. 

![ ](/pics/misc/misc1.png)

Interestingly, men and women are represented perfectly equally in the pictures in the casebook, with four of each appearing. In conjunction with the relative paucity of women in the cases themselves, this means that women are overrepresented in the pictures. Are women just more visually interesting? Is this an attempt at parity? 

### [What Now?](/docs/so_what)

In this section I give tentative recommendations for ways to address the issues that this study points out. The main thrust of the the recommendations is simply including more information to prompt thoughtful, critical discussion. The findings of this study are useful context for the casebook, and a deeper grounding in critical scholarship would bring more attention to the issues revealed here. This could be done by either KCP themselves, in the notes, or professors who teach from the casebook.
