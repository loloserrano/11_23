# Frugging KCP

This project analyzes gender in Knapp, Crystal, and Prince’s *Problems in Contract Law: Cases and Materials.* It is directly inspired by Mary Joe Frug's "Re-Reading Contracts: A Feminist Analysis of a Contracts Casebook. "

> A casebook is a powerful document. The editorial choices within a casebook determine how many readers think about the law of a doctrinal area, about lawyering in that field, about clients, and about legal reasoning.

##### Mary Joe Frug, Re-Reading Contracts: A Feminist Analysis of a Contracts Casebook, 34 AM. U. L. REV. 1065, 1069 (1985).

This project compares the ways in which women appear in the casebook differently from men. In doing so, it reviews historical differences in the ways women and men have been able to live their lives. Most Americans expected women not to participate in the government or the formal economy from the country’s inception to the early twentieth century, and not to occupy public positions of capitalist power until the middle of the twentieth century. There is a massive historical disparity in the relative power of women in public (again, as a political population) and men (the same), that is slowly edging towards parity according mostly to economic metrics. 

For better or worse, the casebook does represent this dynamic. Presenting these inequalities accurately reflects the general exclusion of women from public life and contracts law for most of American history. The limited universe of American contracts presented in a this casebook provide an interesting venue to examine a snapshot of flawed, gendered, improving, complicated law.

## Mary Joe Frug 
### (1941-1991)

Mary Joe Frug was a gender and legal theorist who produced luminary work on oppressive gendered patterns in American law. She is credited with producing some of the first postmodernist feminist work. Frug's ["Re-Reading Contracts"](/docs/rereadingcontracts) is the direct inspiration for this.

## Table of Contents

### [On Style](/docs/on_style)

In this section I defend my grammatical creativity. 

### [Re-Reading Contracts and Updating Frug](/docs/rereading)

In this section I describe the purpose, framework, and theory of this project. I detail the work of Mary Joe Frug on which this project is based and introduce new ideas, both from her other pieces and from later work, that complicate the idea of gender. 

### [Data Collection and Dataset](/docs/dataset)

In this section I describe my data collection process and display some of the raw information. 

### [The Cases: General Overview](/docs/cases)

In this section I describe some very big-picture patterns in the data: general gender breakdown, transaction type, etc.

### [The Characters: Wives, Widows, Workers](/docs/characters/_index)

In this section I get to the juicier, qualitative stuff. I explore the individual humans who appear in the casebook as characters, understood, framed, and described by judges and casebook editors. Most of my focus in the section is on women, who appear as a minority of characters and in a strictly limited set of roles. Most strikingly, over half of the women appear in the litigation with a heterosexual partner; nearly another quarter of the women appear with another family member. 

### [The Characteristics: He's a Business, Man](/docs/trying)

In this section I explore general notions of masculinity and femininity as they appear in the casebook. The most striking pattern here is the number of businesses with masculine names (William G. Eurice & Bros., Inc., James Baird Co.). This raises some questions about corporate personhood, a legal fiction that allows corporations to exist and participate in the legal system. Is there an implied masculinity to the corporate "person?"
