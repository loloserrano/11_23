</div>
<p><em>Frugging KCP</em> borrows heavily from Mary Joe Frug’s methods in “Re-Reading Contracts: A Feminist Analysis of a Contracts Casebook” to Knapp, Crystal, and Prince’s <em>Problems in Contract Law: Cases and Materials</em> (KCP).</p>
<p>This project applies Fruggish methods to analyze the way that KCP represents gender. Most of the individuals who appears in the cases have one of two discernible binary genders: man or woman. Interestingly, several of the businesses have names that suggest gender - usually masculine - as well. There are substantial qualitative and quantitative differences between men and the women in the casebook, with the predominant thrust being limitations on the agency and participation of women.</p>

<h2>KCP</h2>
<p>Knapp, Crystal, and Prince’s <em>Problems in Contract Law</em> (KCP) is an American contracts casebook that attempts, in good faith and with a commercial incentive, to relay the current state and relevant history of American contract law to first-year law students.</p>
<p>KCP is organized around the simple stated goal of producing a “realistic survey of contract law for present-day law students.” It has no stated theory of gender or social justice, but “urges” in its preface that the student “view the material from a variety of other perspectives:”</p>
<p>Historical:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the development of our common law of contract in the English courts of Law and Equity, and trace the historical progression of American contracts law from Holmes [a man] and Williston [a man] through Corbin [a man] and Llewellyn [a man] to the present day.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Theoretical:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>presenting “extended quotations” from “scholars representing all modern schools of analysis.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A critical note: in section “The Perspective of Contract Theory” from pages 12-14, the editors name representative scholars, a jumping off point if students choose to do future research, for all schools of thought - Pound for sociological jurisprudence, Langdell for formalism, Llewellyn for realists, etc. - save one: Critical Legal Studies.</p>
<p>Lawyering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“reminding the student repeatedly that the rules of law we encounter have an impact on real people in real disputes, and that creative lawyering in the contract area requires not merely knowledge of the rules of law but the ability to analyze and predict the effects of various courses of conduct that a client might take.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>KCP conclude with a section that they highlight as having appeared in every edition since 1976: “No study of law is adequate if it loses sight of the fact that law operates first and last <em>for, upon,</em> and <em>through</em> individual human beings. This, of course, is what rescues law from the status of a science and makes its study so frustrating, and so fascinating.”</p>

<h6>Charles L. Knapp, Nathan M. Crystal, &amp; Harry G. Prince, <em>Problems in Contract Law: Cases and Materials</em> xxi-xxiv (9th ed. 2019).</h6>
<p>As my critical note may suggest, I favor including a fourth and more critical perspective. Portions of KCP’s description of “lawyering” and their final quotation provide a jumping off point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rules of law we encounter have an impact on real people in real disputes … No study of law is adequate if it loses sight of the fact that law oeprates first and last <em>for, upon,</em> and <em>through</em> individual human beings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These human beings do, of course, exist in particular places at particular times. These human beings have cultures, shared beliefs, and unspoken rules of power, behavior, and identity. These particular human beings are Americans [with a few exceptions] in the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries, and as such they have very strictly defined binary genders. They are not just people: they are <em>men,</em> and they are <em>women.</em></p>
</div>
<div id="yes-gender-is-a-historically-located-social-construct" class="section level3">
<h3>Yes, gender is a historically located social construct</h3>
<p>KCP itself urges in its preface that the student view the material from a variety of other perspectives. I suggested another perspective from which to view the casebook. The casebook, a good faith representation of contract law with little consideration of gender, nevertheless reflects the gender system of the society within which it was created.</p>
<p>My critical queer perspective firmly situates this binary gender system firmly within 19th, 20th, and 21st century America. This system of strictly binary gender with its host of unique, quirky, and toxic stereotypes is a historical phenomenon. So I study and describe men and women not as universal, binary, inherent categories, but as the problematic, particularized, raced, classed, and gendered identities of people in a certain time and place.</p>
<p>KCP reveals significant gendered patterns in how (mostly white and relatively well off) people and organizations have interacted with contract law. Showing the inequities is not a problem with the casebook itself, as any strictly accurate historical and contemporary account of American contract law will be predominated by the American understanding of men. This purpose of this critical Fruggish study is not to denounce the editors for having reflected inequality and gender stereotypes; it is merely to critically evaluate the inequality and stereotypes that do appear.</p>

<h2>“Re-Reading Contracts”</h2>
<p>Frug’s “Re-Reading Contracts” is a thorough review of Dawson, Harvey, and Henderson’s <em>Cases and Comment on Contracts</em> (4th ed. 1982).</p>
<div id="the-premise" class="section level3">
<h3>The Premise</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A casebook is a powerful document. The editorial choices within a casebook determine how many readers think about the law of a doctrinal area, about lawyering in that field, about clients, and about legal reasoning.</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="mary-joe-frug-re-reading-contracts-a-feminist-analysis-of-a-contracts-casebook-34-am.-u.-l.-rev.-1065-1985." class="section level5">
<h5>Mary Joe Frug, Re-Reading Contracts: A Feminist Analysis of a Contracts Casebook, 34 AM. U. L. REV. 1065 (1985).</h5>
<p>KCP is a powerful document. For me, and for many other first year law students, KCP will always be a foundational reference for the universe of American contract law. It is the first holistic account of contract law that I have ever seen.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="the-objective" class="section level3">
<h3>The Objective</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>My objective is critical in character, for I believe a feminist analysis should change one’s consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would describe my perspective as more queer than feminist but I completely sign on to this. I urge my readers to view KCP, and all of law, from another perspective: one in which the identities and relative power of the parties, judges, and editors play a role.</p>
<div id="re-reading-contracts-1065" class="section level6">
<h6>Re-Reading Contracts 1065</h6>
<p>In some ways, Frug’s defense of the term “feminist” in “Rereading Contracts” does address my concerns:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The analysis of <em>Dawson, Harvey, and Henderson</em> which follows is primarily concerned with the power of gender in the casebook. It is this focus on gender that makes me claim my analysis is feminist. I use”gender" to mean the reductive, dualistic classification of a wide array of social and psychological characteristics <em>according to biological sex</em> [emphasis added]. Gender has power because we use it as a category to explain differences among individuals; it is an idea that organizes and colors many of our responses to others.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="re-reading-contracts-1066" class="section level5">
<h5>Re-Reading Contracts 1066</h5>
<p>“Biological sex” is a category that I find problematic, and that Frug articulated well later on in her career. In her last public work “A Postmodern Feminist Legal Manifesto (An Unfinished Draft),” she offered this definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sex differences are semiotic - that is, constituted by a system of signs that we produce and interpret.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="mary-joe-frug-a-postmodern-feminist-legal-manifesto-an-unfinished-draft-harvard-law-review-105-no.-5-1048-1046-mar.-1992." class="section level5">
<h5>Mary Joe Frug, A Postmodern Feminist Legal Manifesto (An Unfinished Draft), Harvard Law Review 105 No. 5 1048, 1046 (Mar. 1992).</h5>
<p>As a critical queer, I find this to be a really apt definition far ahead of its time. While sexual differences are <em>real</em>, in a physical and tangible sense, biological sex is in no way perfectly and reliability binary. There are enormous phenotypic differences between different “males” and different “females,” and while many sexual characteristics appear along binary distributions, there is a substantial in-between.</p>
<p>The firm sexual binary that undergirds so much of our society, and facilitates binarily gendered names, pronouns, clothing, jobs, domestic responsibilities, mannerisms, and so on, is not universally applicable. Most cultures develop some sort of cultural code around sexual differences. However, the strict limitation to <em>two categories</em> and the particular stereotypes associated with <em>both</em> are strictly American.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, I want to demonstrate that readers’ views about gender affect their understanding of a law casebook. Second, I want to demonstrate that gendered aspects of a casebook affect readers’ understanding of the law and of themselves.</p>

<h2>Frugging: Applying the Methodology in “Re-Reading Contracts”</h2>
<div id="women-as-characters" class="section level3">
<h3>Women as Characters</h3>
<p>Frug described her first “kind of discussion” as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the first part, my analysis proceeds from concrete questions regarding women. I look at women as “characters” in the cases, among the “authors” whose decisions or legal commentary the editors have included in the book, and in the language of the book.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Frug’s analysis of women as “characters” included hard numbers on how many women appeared in the book and qualitative analysis of how those women were represented by judges and casebook editors.</p>

<div id="abstract-characteristics" class="section level3">
<h3>Abstract Characteristics</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In the second part, my focus shifts to comparisons between abstract characteristics which we commonly attribute to men and characteristics of the casebook. I shall concentrate, in other words, on the analytical, autonomous, abstract, and neutral qualities of the book … my aim in this second part is to reveal the gendered aspects of the book which do not directly pertain to women.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My observations about abstract characteristics in KCP are similar to Frug’s. Women appear as an absence in many respects, with the most salient</p>

<h2>Neo-Fruggish Analysis</h2>
<div id="neo-fruggish-analysis-of-characters" class="section level3">
<h3>Neo-Fruggish Analysis of Characters</h3>
<p>My analogue to Frug’s analysis of Women of Characters is <a href="/docs/characters/_index">The Characters: Wives, Widows, Workers.</a></p>
<p>I am interested in analyzing power relationships, so much of my analysis focuses on women, a largely suppressed group. However, men and masculinity also appear in interesting and immensely diverse ways. I do think that study of men and masculinity is as valuable as the study of women and femininity; but as this casebook represents exclusion and largely conditional inclusion of women, that occupies the majority of my analysis.</p>
<p>I collected data on the number of women appearing as parties in the cases, as well as men and as assorted organizations. As a Zoomer I’m semi savvy with computers and data manipulation so I use R, blogdown, Hugo, and Netlify to produce data visualizations and make this a website.</p>
<p>Qualitatively, I analyze the women in the casebook as “characters” by noting the contexts in which they appear and the language that is used to describe them, by both the judges in their cases and KCP.</p>

<div id="neo-fruggish-analysis-of-abstract-characteristics" class="section level3">
<h3>Neo-Fruggish Analysis of Abstract Characteristics</h3>
<p>My analogue to Frug’s analysis of abstract gendered characteristics is <a href="/docs/trying">The Characteristics: He’s a Business, Man</a>.</p>
<p>My focus in this section is masculinity rather than femininity. In my critical queer perspective, masculinity is often as relevant as the object of analysis as femininity.</p>
<p>The most striking pattern in masculinity here is the number of businesses with masculine names (William G. Eurice &amp; Bros., Inc., James Baird Co.). This raises some questions about corporate personhood, a legal fiction that allows corporations to exist and participate in the legal system. Is there an implied masculinity to the corporate “person?”</p>
