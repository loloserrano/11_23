# The Goal of this Project

*Frugging KCP* applies Mary Joe Frug's methods in "Re-Reading Contracts: A Feminist Analysis of a Contracts Casebook" to Knapp, Crystal, and Prince's *Problems in Contract Law: Cases and Materials* (KCP).

This project applies Fruggish methods to analyze the way that KCP represents gender. Most of the individuals who appears in the cases have one of two discernible binary genders: man or woman. Interestingly, several of the businesses have names that suggest gender - usually masculine - as well. There are substantial qualitative and quantitative differences in the men and the women in the casebook.

## "Re-Reading Contracts"

Frug's "Re-Reading Contracts" is a thorough review of Dawson, Harvey, and Henderson's *Cases and Comment on Contracts* (4th ed. 1982). 

Frug's piece is based on a particular view of casebooks that I wholeheartedly adopt. 

> A casebook is a powerful document. The editorial choices within a casebook determine how many readers think about the law of a doctrinal area, about lawyering in that field, about clients, and about legal reasoning.

> First, I want to demonstrate that readers' views about gender affect their understanding of a law casebook. Second, I want to demonstrate that gendered aspects of a casebook affect readers' understanding of the law and of themselves.

As a first semester 1L, KCP is essentially the entirety of the field of contracts law that I and my peers are exposed to, with the exception of three scholarly pieces. 

 I am somewhat alienated by the term "feminist," because I use nonbinary pronouns and am interested equally in addressing traditional binary inequality and in challenging the very idea of a gender *and sexual* binary. 
 
In some ways, Frug's defense of the term "feminist" in "Rereading Contracts" does address my concerns:
 
> "The analysis of *Dawson, Harvey, and Henderson* which follows is primarily concerned with the power of gender in the casebook. It is this focus on gender that makes me claim my analysis is feminist. I use "gender" to mean the reductive, dualistic classification of a wide array of social and psychological characteristics *according to biological sex* [emphasis added]. Gender has power because we use it as a category to explain differences among individuals; it is an idea that organizes and colors many of our responses to others.

##### Re-Reading Contracts 1066

"Biological sex" is a category that I find problematic, and that Frug articulated well later on in her career. In her last public work "A Postmodern Feminist Legal Manifesto (An Unfinished Draft)," she offered this definition: 

> Sex differences are semiotic - that is, constituted by a system of signs that we produce and interpret.

##### Mary Joe Frug, A Postmodern Feminist Legal Manifesto (An Unfinished Draft), Harvard Law Review 105 No. 5 1048, 1046 (Mar. 1992).

As a critical queer, I find this to be a really apt definition far ahead of its time. While sexual differences are *real*, in a physical and tangible sense, biological sex is in no way perfectly and reliability binary. There are enormous phenotypic differences between different "males" and different "females," and while many sexual characteristics appear along binary distributions, there is always a substantial in-between. 

 > "My objective is critical in character, for I believe a feminist analysis should change one's consciousness."

This I wholeheartedly subscribe to, and consider a very important part of critical queer theory. This kind of analysis is about changing the framework within we analyze legal cases and trends. 

## What is Gender? 

The difference between gender and sex is somewhat meaningless, and "sex" is too often harnessed for pseudoscientific, simplistic, and harmful ends. 

The gender that I'm analyzing hree. 

In a normative, social sense, I believe that it's possible to embrace a norm of a general human person in all reasonable circumstances, rather than two separate norms of human *men* and human *women*. It is and has been the American norm to accept two strict categories. This is not necessarily or inherently the case, and analyzing *all* of the ways in which gendered differences appear can reveal the inherent inequalities in maintaining this arbitrary binary. 

This binary is often socially harmful, and enables substantive differences in social and legal outcomes that are based in stereotype rather than essence and merit. 

Sexual differences are obvious relevant, tangible, and uniquely salient in several circumstances, as in reproductive health, medical health, and sexual violence. (Although sexual violence, I would argue, while not entirely socially constructed and fueled by some biological differences, is social in that deliberate behavioral decisions *can* fix the issue. It is not an inherent biological hecho; it can be eliminated through constructive social change.)

I see sexual differences as something that should be respected and addressed in several important circumstances, but are taken to an unhealthy extreme in linguistic practices like strict binary pronouns and the wealth of unhealthy norms that we apply to different genders.

At worst, idealized masculinity results in a set of characteristics that our society has already deemed "toxic:" aggressiveness, violence, body anxiety about smallness and weakness, sexual insecurity and a disdain for the people they perceive as sexual objects. Idealized femininity results in social passivity, an intense focus on appearance (and smallness!) to the point of eating disorders, fueled by a massive "beauty" industry. 

What if we idealized a human? An ungendered individual? The qualities that make a good person a good person? What if we reflected that in our pronouns? 
If gender is socially constructed - as in, all the linguistic and behavioral stereotypes we associate with biology that are entirely constituted by socially influenced psychology and behavior - *all gender is oppression.* 

Some of those extremely gendered behaviors are creative, interesting, and popular, such as women's fashion or men's sports; but these behaviors could exist, grow, and flourish in the absence of gendered difference. Strict binary gender creates only restriction and limitation. 

In a legal sense, courts are used to applying law to men and traditionally masculine activities. Legal reforms addressing women are often favorable, with better outcomes in child custody, a rapidly rising rate of education flowing in part from Title IX, and the many cases included in KCP that involve vulnerable women being taken advantage of and framed as parties obviously in the right. 

Of course, the traditional exclusion of women from lawmaking positions and legal consideration cannot be minimized or ignored. And the situations in which women do appear are largely - [to an enormous extent](/docs/characters/_index) - related to family disputes. In most of the situations in which women do appear,  

### Consciousness

So this is the **consciousness** that I want to promote. I read cases as not *necessarily, inherently* involving gender, and analyze *every* respect in which I see gender affecting the casebook as a social and likely to be problematic phenomenon. This is, after all, a *critical* analysis.

Realistically, I have to adopt the binary categories of man and woman in my analysis. But normatively I reject these categories as absolutes. 

Of course, I also recognize and respect that most people subscribe to one of these categories and expect others to use a binary set of pronouns in describing them. Frug, for instance, was very much a proud woman and used she/her pronouns, which I will honor. 

## Frug's Methodology

### Fruggish Women as Characters

Frug described her first "kind of discussion" as follows:

> In the first part, my analysis proceeds from concrete questions regarding women. I look at women as "characters" in the cases, among the "authors" whose decisions or legal commentary the editors have included in the book, and in the language of the book. 

Frug's analysis of women as "characters" included hard numbers on how many women appeared in the book and qualitative analysis of how those women were represented by judges and casebook editors.

### Fruggish Abstract Characteristics

> In the second part, my focus shifts to comparisons between abstract characteristics which we commonly attribute to men and characteristics of the casebook. I shall concentrate, in other words, on the analytical, autonomous, abstract, and neutral qualities of the book ... my aim in this second part is to reveal the gendered aspects of the book which do not directly pertain to women.  

My observations about abstract characteristics in KCP are similar to Frug's. Women appear as an absence in many 

## Neo-Fruggish Analysis

### Neo-Fruggish Analysis of Characters

My analogue to Frug's analysis of Women of Characters is [The Characters: Wives, Widows, Workers.](/docs/characters/_index)

I am interested in analyzing power relationships, so much of my analysis focuses on women, a largely suppressed group. However, men and masculinity also appear in interesting and immensely diverse ways. I do think that study of men and masculinity is as valuable as the study of women and femininity; but as this casebook represents exclusion and largely conditional inclusion of women, that occupies the majority of my analysis. 

I collected data on the number of women appearing as parties in the cases, as well as men and as assorted organizations. As a Zoomer I'm semi savvy with computers and data manipulation so I use R, blogdown, Hugo, and Netlify to produce data visualizations and make this a website. 

Qualitatively, I analyze the women in the casebook as "characters" by noting the contexts in which they appear and the language that is used to describe them, by both the judges in their cases and KCP. 

### Neo-Fruggish Analysis of Abstract Characteristics

My analogue to Frug's analysis of abstract gendered characteristics is [The Characteristics: He's a Business, Man](/docs/trying). 

My focus in this section is masculinity rather than femininity. In my critical queer perspective, masculinity is often as relevant as the object of analysis as femininity. 

The most striking pattern in masculinity here is the number of businesses with masculine names (William G. Eurice & Bros., Inc., James Baird Co.). This raises some questions about corporate personhood, a legal fiction that allows corporations to exist and participate in the legal system. Is there an implied masculinity to the corporate "person?"
