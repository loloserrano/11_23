<h2>Marriage and Family</h2>
<p>Women in KCP are vastly, vastly more likely than men or individuals of unknown gender to appear in litigation with a heterosexual partner or a family member. Even discounting miscellaneous family status, a <strong>majority - 56% - </strong> of women appearing in KCP appear with heterosexual partners. <strong>70%</strong> of women appear with a partner or family member. So only <strong>30% of women in KCP - less than a third!! - appear independent of a relative.</strong> In contrast, 70% of men and 100% of individuals of unknown gender appear independent of a relative.</p>

<h2>Little Discernable Change over Time?</h2>
<p>The following charts are split by gender and show each individual litigant who appears, colored by their spousal/family status. You can hover over the dots to see the name of the individual and the case in which they appear. If you double-click on any of the colored dots in the legend, the chart will isolate that category.</p>
<p>I don’t discern any particularly interesting trends over time, but you might disagree.</p>
<p><em>You can scroll around the chart - each dot has the name and year of the woman it represents.
All cases are randomly dispersed along the y axis to make the individual points easier to see. Vertical position is arbitrary.

<h5>14 N.E.3d 605 (Ill. 2014); KCP 129</h5>
<p>This is one of the cases about a <a href="/docs/characters/characters3">vulnerable widow being taken advantage of</a>. The court affirmed a summary judgment that a contract between Virginia H. Rogers, offering over $5.5 million in assets upon her death, and George Dohrmann, promising to add Rogers as a middle name for both of his sons, was unenforceable because the consideration was illusory (and “so grossly adequate as to shock the conscience.”)</p>
<p>Dohrmann is first introduced merely as “the appellant” and Rogers as “deceased (The Estate). The next information revealed is that Dohrmann was Rogers’ neighbor, and had minor children. The first robust introduction that Judge Fitzgerald Smith of the Illinois Appellate Court gave to the characters is as follows, in the”Background" section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the time they met, Mrs. Rogers was 73-year-old widow. She had never had nor adopted any children. Dohrmann was a 40-year-old neurosurgeon, married to Dr. Helen Dohrmann.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I explore more thoroughly in the <a href="/docs/characters/characters3">widows section</a>, Mrs. Rogers’ old age and husbandlessness play into a sense of vulnerability, which explicitly ties into the court’s ruling of illusory consideration and dictum that the case could have been found void on the grounds of “unfairness” alone. The judge repeatedly mentions that Mrs. Rogers was not only old, but <em>also a widow,</em> harnessing general cultural assumptions about vulnerability to bolster their argument.</p>
<p>What value does the inclusion of Dohrmann’s job, his marriage, and his wife’s job add to the opinion? Perhaps Dohrmann’s marital status establishes that he was not as sad and lonely as Rogers is implied to be, or merely to contextualize his having children. The more interesting tidbit is the inclusion of both of their jobs. Simply in terms of gender representation, a side mention as “Dr. Helen Dohrmann” implies status, power, and wealth not usually associated with women. But it’s unlikely that Judge Fitzgerald Smith’s goal was to subtly challenge gender stereotypes. Perhaps the occupations establish that the Dohrmanns were well off, ruling out any moral defense based on need.</p>

<p>In Aceves v. U.S. Bank, N.A. the judge present the plaintiff, a woman independently bringing a suit whose spouse appears only as a minor detail in the rest of the opinion, as “Claudia Aceves, a married woman.” (255) The case is about bankruptcy – perhaps her marriage establishes some kind of moral credibility? There might be some kind of difference in the judge’s mind between a bankrupted single woman and a bankrupted wife.</p>
