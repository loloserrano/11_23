## Widows
 
Three women were described not with reference to husbands, but to the absence of husbands. Three widows appear in the casebook, all of whom are posed as vulnerable people being taken advantage of. There are no widowers. 

In two of the widows’ cases, their judges lament their age and husbandless-ness at length. 

### *Syster v. Banta*
##### 133 N.W.2d 666 (Iowa 1965); KCP 611

In *Syester v. Banta,* Justice Snell of the Iowa Supreme Court describes the plaintiff as such: 

> Plaintiff is a lonely and elderly widow who fell for the blandishments and flattery of those who saw some ‘easy money’ available. 

She was “a widow living alone. She has no family. Her exact age does not appear,” but the judge provides one estimate of 68 (so not exactly on death's door!) The judge denounced the dancing studio employees who flattered her talent: 

> She testified 'He promised me all the privileges of the studio and I would be a professional dancer.' To make such a promise to a lady plaintiff’s age was ridiculous. The fact that she was so gullible as to be an easy victim does not justify taking over $29,000 of her money.”

We probably shouldn't read too much into the inclusion of the picture - casebook editors are required to include a certain number of images and just look for any appropriate place to do it. However, the inclusion of this picture of young, famous, vibrant, talented people - one of them a beautiful woman - does produce a stark contrast to the way that Snell describes the poor old widow. Providing readers with this image next to the pitying, paternalistic tone of the judge does seem to reinforce the juxtaposition: young people who are good dancers and don't need protection, and poor old ladies who don't stand a chance. 

### *Dohrmann v. Swaney*
##### 14 N.E.3d 605 (Ill. 2014); KCP 129

Another widow to appear is described similarly by Judge Fitzgerald Smith of the Alabama Supreme Court, who repeatedly emphasizes her age and husbandlessness. 

> “At the time they met, Mrs. Rogers was a 73-year-old widow."

> “In total, pursuant to the terms of the contract, Mrs. Rogers, an elderly widow, agreed to give Dohrmann upon her death ... 

> “At the time of the contract’s execution in 2000, Mrs. Rogers was an 89 year old widow whose husband had died many years previously... She had no children nor any immediate family."

Most of the opinion focuses on the nefarious misdeeds of George J. Dohrmann, who convinced Rogers to bequeath millions of dollars to him upon her death. Rogers is consistently posed in the background as a lonely, vulnerable victim, deceased at the time of litigation and unable to speak for herself. 

### *Kirksey v. Kirksey*
##### 8 Ala. 131 (1845); KCP 227

The language of the Kirksey opinion itself is not nearly as charged: 

> The plaintiff was the wife of defendant's brother, but had for some time been a widow, and had several children. 

The framing of vulnerability is less in the case itself, but the casebook. The editors pose Kirksey as an unjust and obsolete alternative to the newer, better concept of promissory estoppel; this poor widow moved across state only to be kicked out of her home with no recourse, having been invited as a matter of "mere gratuity." 

## What do we make of this? 

In the two cases in which the plaintiff's husbandlessness and vulnerability was bemoaned at length, the courts ruled in their favor and expressed moral outrage at the manipulative situations they had been in. In the case of Kirksey, the editors are clearly making an argument that the widow should have been protected by law, and that if the case had come later in time she would have been protected. 

So the legal system here is working in favor of these vulnerable women, not against them. At the same time, there's a heavy element of paternalism and pity that can't be ignored. At the same time that their legal interests are protected, it would be a stretch to say they're empowered by the law in any way. The pity benefits them to an extent, but is still demeaning.
