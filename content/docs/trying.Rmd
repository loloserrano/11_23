## The Corporate "Person"

Corporations have long been viewed as persons under the law. This legal fiction confers on the corporations legal rights and legal obligations, allowing corporations to enter into contracts, own property, sue, and be sued. 

The development of the American corporation is, as with much American history, overwhelmingly male. Gendered stereotypes and patterns abound in the actual organizations themselves. There is a substantial amount of attention being given now to the gender dynamics among the groups of humans who make corporate America. 

There doesn't seem to be much scholarship about gendered stereotypes being imputed to the corporate "person" itself (himself?). Interestingly, of the many corporations and other businesses that appear in KCP, 23 have names that communicate gender in some respect. 19 of these are masculine, including first names (Arthur, Danny, Marshall) or group identifiers (Messrs. or Bros). Only four are feminine. I think this raises some questions about the extent to which gendered stereotypes get imputed to the fictitious corporate "person," and what implications that might have for business and law. 

Are corporations really just "people?" Or are corporations *men*?

## Masculine Businesses  

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
mbusinesses <- parties %>%
  filter(typemf == "MBusiness") %>%
  select(name, year, page, simplecite)
names(mbusinesses) <- c("Business","Year","Page in KCP","Case")

mbusinesses %>%
  kbl() %>%
  scroll_box(fixed_thead = T, height = "300px") 

```
## Feminine Businesses

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
wbusinesses <- parties %>%
  filter(typemf == "FBusiness") %>%
  select(name, year, page, simplecite)
names(wbusinesses) <- c("Business","Year","Page in KCP","Case")

wbusinesses %>%
  knitr::kable() %>%
  scroll_box(fixed_thead = TRUE, height = "300px") 

```


I have some very vague ideas about the development of capitalism in a culture that strictly defined work according to gender roles and relegated women either to the home, in largely white middle-class cases and Victorian norms, or to service-related jobs like housekeeping and child-rearing that also posed women as the only ones capable of communal values, nurturing, and love, while men were all about the competition and toughness necessary for market success. bell hooks' excellent Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center brings up great points about how feminism focused on equality with men just aims to assimilate individual women into this problematic culture, but also criticizes the conflation of women with those artificial traditionally feminine traits. But there's something to be said about how very gendered the development of capitalism has been, traditionally, that might ultimately reveal some of its fundamental flaws. Is highly competitive, depersonalized, emotionless American-style capitalism sustainable without the artificial imposition on half of the population with the responsibility for teaching love, nurturing, and values?
